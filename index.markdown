I'm a 19-year-old undergraduate at [Rose-Hulman](https://www.rose-hulman.edu/) about to start my third and final year of my degree. Along the way, I am picking up minors in computer science and theoretical physics. When I'm not doing math, you can usually find me hiking, skiing, or generally enjoying the outdoors. I also love sharing mathematics with others, for example as a Counselor for [Ross](https://rossprogram.org/).

I like basically every topic in pure math, but my particular favorite subject is Algebraic number theory, especially Iwasawa theory and Galois cohomology. I'm currently on a quest to read and understand all of Neukirch, Schmidt, and Wingberg's [Cohomology of Number Fields](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-540-37889-1), which is a book I owe a lot of my mathematical development to.

My senior thesis advisor is [Dr. Tim All](https://www.rose-hulman.edu/academics/faculty/all-timothy-all1.html), where we will be looking at p-adic L-functions and Iwasawa theory. I also had the pleasure of working for him in 2023 as a Ross counselor.

In the summer of 2024, I worked under [Dr. Hui Xue](https://huixue.people.clemson.edu/) in the [Clemson REU in number theory](https://huixue.people.clemson.edu/REU.html), where we studied Rankin-Cohen brackets of modular forms and elliptic curves over finite fields.
